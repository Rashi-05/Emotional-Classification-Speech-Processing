# Audio-Based Emotion Recognition Web App

A machine learning-powered web application that identifies emotions in speech audio clips. This project uses audio feature extraction and classification models to recognize human emotions such as **Angry, Calm, Fearful, Happy, Neutral, Sad, and Surprised**.

## Objective

To build an interactive tool that:

â€¢ Accepts a user-uploaded `.wav` or `.mp3` file  
â€¢ Automatically extracts and processes key audio features using Librosa  
â€¢ Predicts the emotion present in the audio using a pre-trained machine learning model  
â€¢ Presents the result in a clean and user-friendly web interface powered by Streamlit

## Methadology

1. **Feature Extraction**  
   Audio files are processed using Librosa to extract:  
   â€¢ MFCCs  
   â€¢ Chroma Features  
   â€¢ Mel Spectrogram  
   â€¢ Spectral Contrast  
   â€¢ Tonnetz Features  
   **Output:** 193-dimensional feature vector per audio sample.
   
2. **Preprocessing**  
   Audio features are transformed through:  
   â€¢ MinMax Scaling to normalize feature values  
   â€¢ PCA to reduce noise and dimensionality (retaining 98% variance)
3. **Classification**  
   Two classifiers were trained and evaluated:  
   â€¢ MLP (Multi-layer Perceptron) â€“ deep neural net with dropout and regularization  
   â€¢ SVC (Support Vector Classifier) â€“ with tuned hyperparameters for improved performance
   
The best results were achieved using SVC after removing underperforming emotion classes (like 'Disgust').

## Tech Stack

â€¢ Python 3.x  
â€¢ Librosa â€“ for audio feature extraction  
â€¢ scikit-learn â€“ for ML models, scaling, and PCA  
â€¢ TensorFlow / Keras â€“ for MLP model implementation  
â€¢ Streamlit â€“ to build the interactive web app  
â€¢ Ngrok â€“ for deployment (e.g., via Colab tunnels)
